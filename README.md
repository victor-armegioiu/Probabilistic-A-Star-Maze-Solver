# Probabilistic-A-Star-Maze-Solver
A* search with a cool twist, some cells in the maze are portals than instantly transport you to other cells based on a discrete distribution. 
What if we didn't know beforehand the teleportation destinations and their probabilities? This situation is handled by the approximation method in the
DiscreteDistribution class. Just perform a number of trials for each portal and assess the probabilities of the results.

TODO: 
* mandatory main.py clean-up
* generate comprehensive report of the statistics
